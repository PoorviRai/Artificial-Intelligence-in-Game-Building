This folder contains the java and class files for small and large graph as well as an image of the small graph.

The following classes are used for the implemetation of this part of the assignment: Graph, Edge, Node, SmallGraph and LargeGraph.

Graph is an interface holding the methods getVertices and getEdges. These methods are implemeted in the SmallGraph and LargeGraph classes.
Edge contains the functions of getDestination(), getSource() and getWeight().
Node contains the functions of getID(), getX() and getY().
SmallGraph contains the addNewEdge() function. The constructor of this class creates the graph.
LargeGraph is similarly constructed to the SmallGraph.
